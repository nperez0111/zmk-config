# My ZMK configuration

I made a custom keyboard based on the [Nibble 65% Keyboard](https://nullbits.co/nibble/). It's a 65% keyboard with a rotary encoder. I'm using a [nice!nanov2](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) as the controller, hence this config.

You can read more about this build on [my blog](https://blog.nickthesick.com/projects/Nibble+65%25+Keyboard). While the battery life of the keyboard ended up being pretty horrendous, I'm still pretty happy with the build and love that I have control over the firmware with ZMK.
